# Hey, I'm Stephen

I'm a founder, engineer, designer, and game developer in Southern California.

In 2022 WorkOS acquired my startup Modulz. At WorkOS I led product engineering from early PMF into high-growth scale-up and launched [AuthKit](https://www.authkit.com/), the world's best login.

In 2018 I co-founded [Modulz](https://modulz.app/) with the goal to bridge the gap between designers and developers. Along the way we've created [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/), a11y first React components, and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/), a styling library with excellent DX.

In 2015 I worked as an Engineering Manager at Newell Brands, launching ecommerce sites and eventually moving to NYC to lead the front-end engineering efforts for 300 brands.

In 2014 I ran engineering for a digital agency in the Bay Area, producing high profile sites for companies like Levi's, Dockers, Belk, and Genentech.

I like to make games for fun and in 2015 I wrote a book about Game Development: [Game Development with Swift](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Development-Swift-Stephen-Haney-ebook/dp/B00YSILB6C) and the follow-up [Swift 3 Game Development](https://www.amazon.com/Swift-3-Game-Development-Second-ebook/dp/B01M138PTW).

These days I'm most interested in anything that pushes the web platform forward!
